There is a cat named Chouchou, he loves playing a pen. He sleeps with his master every night.

One day, Chouchou's master gets a new pet, a lovely white rabbit named Coco. He was curious about his new friend, but also worried that his master no longer cared about him.

So Chouchou started playing with Coco, chasing his new friend around the house all day. They were having so much fun together. However to Chouchou's great dissapointment, that night Coco took his spot in the masters bed! He was so sad, that he wont outside and slept on the porch alone.  

He then ran away! He headed towards the hills, where he could be loved again. Oh how unfortunate this could be! If only he could be loved again.

So Chouchou hided himself into the cave, and never be found. -END-
